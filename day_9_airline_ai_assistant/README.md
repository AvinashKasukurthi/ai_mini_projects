| Tirupathi   | ‚Çπ4,000              |
| Ujjain      | ‚Çπ8,000              |
| Ayodhya     | ‚Çπ9,000              |
| Mathura     | ‚Çπ12,000             |
| Vrindavan   | ‚Çπ10,000             |
| Belur       | ‚Çπ19,000             |

## üí° Key Technical Features

### Function Calling Implementation
The assistant uses OpenAI's function calling to retrieve structured data:
```python
price_function = {
    "name": "get_ticket_price",
    "description": "Get the price of a return ticket to the destination city...",
    "parameters": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "destination_city": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "The city that the customer wants to travel to",
            },
        },
        "required": ["destination_city"],
    },
}
```

### Intelligent Tool Handling
Seamlessly processes function calls and integrates responses:
```python
def handle_tool_call(message):
    tool_call = message.tool_calls[0]
    arguments = json.loads(tool_call.function.arguments)
    city = arguments.get("destination_city")
    price = get_ticket_price(city)
    # Returns structured response for the AI to process
```

### Professional Airline Persona
Configured with specific guidelines for airline customer service:
```python
system_message = "You are a helpful assistant for an Airline called FlightAI. "
system_message += "Give short, courteous answers, no more then 1 sentence. "
system_message += "Always be accurate. If you don't know the answer. Say so."
```

## üîß Configuration

### Model Selection
Currently uses GPT-4o-mini for optimal performance and cost efficiency:
```python
MODEL = "gpt-4o-mini"
```

### Adding New Destinations
Easily expand the supported cities by updating the `city_prices` dictionary:
```python
city_prices = {
    "new_city": "‚Çπprice",
    # Add more destinations here
}
```
