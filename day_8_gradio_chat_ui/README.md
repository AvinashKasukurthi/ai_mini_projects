# Day 8: Gradio Chat UI

A simple and elegant chat interface built with Gradio that provides streaming conversations with GPT-4o-mini. This project demonstrates how to create a conversational AI interface with real-time streaming responses and conversation history management.

## 🌟 Features

- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Clean, user-friendly chat UI powered by Gradio
- **Streaming Responses**: Real-time response streaming for better user experience
- **Conversation History**: Maintains context across multiple exchanges
- **OpenAI Integration**: Uses GPT-4o-mini for intelligent responses
- **Technical Assistant**: Configured as a friendly technical assistant
- **Environment Configuration**: Secure API key management with dotenv

## 🎯 What It Does

The application creates a web-based chat interface where users can:
- Have natural conversations with an AI assistant
- Receive streaming responses that appear in real-time
- Maintain conversation context throughout the session
- Get technical help and analysis from the AI

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Set up your OpenAI API key** in a `.env` file:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

2. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   python day_8_gradio_chat_ui/gradio_chat_ui.py
   ```

3. **Open your browser** and navigate to the provided local URL (typically `http://localhost:7860`)

4. **Start chatting** with the AI assistant!

## 💡 Key Technical Features

### Streaming Responses
The application uses OpenAI's streaming API to provide real-time responses:
```python
stream = openai.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-mini", messages=messages, stream=True
)
```

### Conversation History Management
Maintains context by building a complete message history:
```python
messages = [{"role": "system", "content": system_message}]
for user_msg, assistant_msg in history:
    messages.append({"role": "user", "content": user_msg})
    messages.append({"role": "assistant", "content": assistant_msg})
```

### Gradio ChatInterface
Utilizes Gradio's built-in ChatInterface for a polished user experience:
```python
gd.ChatInterface(fn=chat).launch()
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### System Message
The AI is configured with a technical assistant personality:
```python
system_message = (
    "You are a friendly user assistant. Patiently analyse and give reply technically."
)
```

### Model Selection
Currently uses GPT-4o-mini for cost-effective, high-quality responses. You can modify the model in the code:
```python
model="gpt-4o-mini"  # Change to gpt-4, gpt-3.5-turbo, etc.
```

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Python 3.13+
- OpenAI API key
- Required packages:
  - `gradio` - Web interface framework
  - `openai` - OpenAI API client
